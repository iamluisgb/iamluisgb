# Luis GonzÃ¡lez | @iamluisgb

Python Backend Developer with 3+ years of experience.

I am specialized in building applications with Python/Django. Also using technologies such as Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Celery, HTML and Javascript. I have worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server. 

The aspect of my job that I enjoy the most is the design and implementation process of solutions. I am a proactive individual who thrives on challenges and finding the best ways to solve problems. I am particularly passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to my work to improve the performance and efficiency of the applications I develop.

I am able to work independently on a project or integrate into a multidisciplinary team and follow Agile methodologies. I am dedicated to maintaining clear and open communication to ensure alignment with the team and company's objectives.
