# Luis GonzÃ¡lez | @iamluisgb

Site Reliability Engineer with a background in Backend Development with Python. 

Currently, my job is to manage an instance of Rundeck within Roche (the pharmaceutical company) where about 3.000 jobs are executed daily: 
- Deploying CI/CD with Ansible and Jenkins.
- Improving Rundeck performance within a Kubernetes cluster.
- Creating plugins that integrate internal tools with Rundeck using Python and bash.
- Advise rundeck users to create their jobs.

I also have experience building apps with Python/Django. Also using technologies such as Docker, Celery, HTML and Javascript. I have worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server. 

The aspect of my job that I enjoy the most is the design and implementation process of solutions. I am a proactive individual who thrives on challenges and finding the best ways to solve problems. I am particularly passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to my work to improve the performance and efficiency of the applications I develop.

I am able to work independently on a project or integrate into a multidisciplinary team and follow Agile methodologies. I am dedicated to maintaining clear and open communication to ensure alignment with the team and company's objectives.
